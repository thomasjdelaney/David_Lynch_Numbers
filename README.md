This repo is for doing a statistical analysis of David Lynch's daily number draw.
The questions that I want to answer are:

1. Is the draw statistically significantly different from a uniform random distribution?
2. Is there a good method for predicting the number for the next day?

Perhaps these questions could be answered using a few different languages, for fun.
